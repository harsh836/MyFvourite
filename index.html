        <p><b>Why i like reading:</b><br> The endless source of knowledge, information, entertainment, and training are books. Before the age of the internet, books were the most dominating source of knowledge. But of course, with technology, the forms of books have changed, and books have become more accessible to everyone.
            <br>
            Regardless of all other supplements of books, the contribution and role of books in our life are indispensable. In the education system, books are mostly followed to date for knowledge providing and gain. Books on several subjects enhance several aspects of education and learning. Writers can express their thoughts, views, and observations about any topic through their writings, which are published in books.For general knowledge about anything, we seek books like encyclopedias, atlas, and dictionaries. And then there are also those books that guide us while we are dealing with certain tasks like cookbooks, travel books, self-help books, etc.
            <br>
            It is no news that books are a great source of entertainment as there are many kinds of readers, who are a fan of books like novels, poetry books, short stories, magazines, comics, etc. Sometimes reading also becomes an addiction, but in my opinion, it is a good kind of addiction that will only be beneficial for an individual.
